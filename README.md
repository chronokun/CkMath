CkMath
======

Simple C++ math library with vector, matrix, geometric and trigonometric functions & types intended
to for use in developing 3d game engines. Matrices and vectors are column major and functions assume 
a right handed coordinate system for compatibility with opengl. All angles are in radians unless
otherwise specified.
